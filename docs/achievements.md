# GitHub Achievements Practice Playbook

This file lists small, focused actions you can take in this repo to earn event-based GitHub achievements.

1) Pull Shark — docs & PRs
- Action: Open PRs that improve docs or fix small bugs. Aim for merges into active branches.
- Start: Improve README, add examples, fix typos. Each merged PR counts.

2) YOLO — merge without review
- Action: Create a branch in this repo, open a PR, then merge it yourself. One-time action.

3) Quickdraw — fast close
- Action: Open a tiny issue (typo or small bug), immediately push a fix, and close the issue.

4) Galaxy Brain — Discussions
- Action: Enable Discussions in repo settings, ask and answer technical questions. Accepted answers count.

5) Starstruck — get stars
- Action: Publish practical templates (e.g., SMS/MPesa integration, real estate CRM starter). Share to relevant communities.

Commit message suggestions (used here in practice):
- `docs: add achievements practice playbook` — docs improvement (Pull Shark)
- `fix: small accessibility/typo fix` — quick fix (Quickdraw)
- `feat: add example MPesa template` — publish something useful (Starstruck)
- `chore: merge branch (YOLO)` — simulated merge without review

Notes:
- Real achievements are awarded by GitHub based on events on github.com (PR merges, issue actions, discussions). Pushing local commits is necessary but do the PR/merge/issue actions on GitHub for recognition.

Good luck — I can create branches and step through these commits for you now.

YOLO test note: This repository contains an example branch merged locally to demonstrate a "YOLO" merge (merge without review).
