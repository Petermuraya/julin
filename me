Summary
-------

Senior engineer and architect focused on building production-grade AI + IoT systems that scale. I design and deliver cloud-native, edge-aware solutions for Healthcare, Smart Cities, and commercial applications—prioritizing measurable outcomes, operational reliability, and security.

## Selected projects

- **NeuralEdge X-Ray Analyzer** — PyTorch, ONNX, Raspberry Pi
  - Production model (~92% TB detection) for low-resource clinics; on-device optimizations and resilient sync.
- **SmartCity IoT Mesh** — LoRaWAN, TimescaleDB, Grafana
  - Regional sensor telemetry pipeline with HA ingestion, long-term retention, and live dashboards.
- **Dynamic Pricing Engine** — Next.js, TensorFlow.js, Leaflet
  - Location-aware pricing service that improved hotel revenue by ~30% using demand signals and geospatial features.

Visual & responsiveness notes
-----------------------------

- Icons and badges use lightweight SVG sources (shields) for consistent color and dark/light rendering.
- Images are referenced as plain Markdown so GitHub scales them responsively across devices.

Next steps
----------

- I can commit and push this update to `NEXTJSFEATURE`, and open a PR if you want.
