# Fix Next.js Routing Conflicts

## Tasks
- [ ] Move app/(admin) to app/admin to make admin routes properly under /admin
- [ ] Move contents of app/(public) to app/ root level since they are the public pages
- [ ] Remove conflicting app/about/page.tsx (keep the public one)
- [ ] Remove duplicate root pages (app/page.tsx, app/page.js), keeping only the public homepage
